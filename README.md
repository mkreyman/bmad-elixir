Inspired by [BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), this package brings the proven Agentic Agile Development framework to Elixir and Phoenix projects with specialized AI agents, workflows, and quality gates tailored for the BEAM ecosystem.

## What is BMAD for Elixir?

BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development) provides:

- **ü§ñ Specialized AI Agents** - Expert agents for Elixir/Phoenix development (Dev, QA, Architect, SM)
- **üìã Development Workflows** - Proven workflows for Phoenix features, contexts, and LiveViews
- **‚úÖ Quality Checklists** - Best practices for Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, and LiveView
- **üé£ Git Hooks** - Automated quality enforcement with pre-commit, commit-msg, and post-merge hooks
- **üìñ Story Management** - Structured approach to feature development with backlog, in-progress, and completed stories

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add `bmad_elixir` to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bmad_elixir, "~> 0.1.0", only: :dev, runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Then run:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

### Initialize BMAD in Your Project

```bash
# Basic initialization
mix bmad.init

# Initialize with git hooks
mix bmad.init --hooks
```

This creates:

```

```

## Available Agents

### Core Development Agents

- **elixir-dev** üíª - Senior Elixir/Phoenix Engineer for feature implementation
- **elixir-qa** ‚úÖ - Quality Assurance specialist for testing and validation
- **elixir-architect** üèóÔ∏è - System architect for OTP design and supervision trees
- **elixir-sm** üìã - Scrum Master for story creation and workflow management

### Specialized Agents

- **phoenix-expert** üî• - Phoenix framework specialist (Controllers, LiveView, Channels)
- **ecto-specialist** üóÑÔ∏è - Database expert for schemas, migrations, and queries
- **elixir-release-manager** üöÄ - Release preparation and deployment
- **elixir-documentation-specialist** üìù - Documentation and ExDoc expert

## Usage

### Create a New Story

Copy and customize the story template:

```bash
cp .bmad/templates/story-template.yaml stories/STORY-001.yaml
```

Then edit `stories/STORY-001.yaml` with your story details.

### Use an Agent

Agents are markdown files that can be loaded into AI coding tools like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot. Each agent in `.bmad/agents/` contains:

- Role definition and responsibilities
- Commands and best practices
- Examples and patterns specific to that role

### Follow a Workflow

Workflows provide step-by-step guides for complex tasks. See `.bmad/workflows/` for available workflows:

- `greenfield-phoenix.yaml` - New Phoenix project setup
- `add-phoenix-context.yaml` - Create new bounded context
- `add-liveview-feature.yaml` - Implement LiveView feature

## Git Hooks

BMAD includes production-ready git hooks for quality enforcement:

- **pre-commit** - Runs `mix precommit` (format, credo, dialyzer, test)
- **commit-msg** - Blocks Claude Code attributions, enforces message format
- **prepare-commit-msg** - Shows commit message guidelines
- **post-checkout** - Reminds about migrations when switching branches
- **post-merge** - Reminds about migrations after merges

Install with:

```bash
mix bmad.init --hooks
```

## Claude Code Skills

BMAD includes Claude Code Skills - executable workflows that Claude Code automatically discovers and uses when appropriate.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized capabilities that Claude Code loads on-demand based on your task. Unlike agents (which are comprehensive reference docs), skills are focused, executable workflows with specific triggers.

**Key Differences:**
- **Agents** (`.bmad/agents/`) - Comprehensive expertise you manually reference
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Auto-invoked workflows Claude Code discovers

### Available Skills

**elixir-quality-gate**
- Runs comprehensive quality checks (format, credo, dialyzer, tests)
- Auto-triggers when validating code quality or before commits

**phoenix-generator**
- Guides using `mix phx.gen.*` commands with best practices
- Auto-triggers when creating Phoenix resources or schemas

**ecto-migration-helper**
- Creates and manages Ecto migrations safely
- Auto-triggers when working with database schema changes

**elixir-test-runner**
- Runs ExUnit tests with smart filtering and debugging
- Auto-triggers when running or debugging tests

**phoenix-context-creator**
- Creates well-designed Phoenix contexts following best practices
- Auto-triggers when designing new features or contexts

### Installation

```bash
# Install skills to .claude/skills/
mix bmad.init --skills

# Install both hooks and skills
mix bmad.init --hooks --skills
```

### How Skills Work

Skills use YAML frontmatter to declare when they should activate:

```yaml
---
name: elixir-quality-gate
description: Run comprehensive Elixir quality checks (format, credo, dialyzer, tests). Use when validating code quality or before commits.
---
```

When you ask Claude Code to "run quality checks," it automatically:
1. Reads skill descriptions
2. Identifies relevant skills
3. Loads and executes the appropriate workflow

### Project vs Personal Skills

**Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Shared with team via git:
```bash
mix bmad.init --skills  # Installs to .claude/skills/
git add .claude/skills/
```

**Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Your personal toolkit:
```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Creating Custom Skills

See the installed skills as examples. Each skill is a directory containing:
- `SKILL.md` (required) - YAML frontmatter + instructions
- `scripts/` (optional) - Helper scripts
- `templates/` (optional) - Code templates

## Local Development

### Running Quality Checks

Run all quality checks locally before committing:

```bash
mix precommit
```

This runs:
1. **Format check** - `mix format --check-formatted`
2. **Compilation** - `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
3. **Credo** - `mix credo --strict`
4. **Dialyzer** - `mix dialyzer` (type checking)
5. **Tests** - `mix test`

If you have git hooks installed, these checks run automatically on every commit.

### Individual Quality Checks

Run checks individually during development:

```bash
# Format code
mix format

# Static analysis
mix credo --strict

# Type checking (first run builds PLT - takes 1-2 minutes)
mix dialyzer

# Run tests
mix test
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions

This package includes a production-ready GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs on every push and pull request.

#### Pipeline Jobs

1. **Quality Check** (runs once)
   - Code formatting validation
   - Compilation with warnings as errors
   - Credo static analysis (strict mode)

2. **Tests** (matrix: Elixir 1.14-1.16, OTP 25-26)
   - Runs test suite on multiple Elixir/OTP versions
   - Ensures compatibility across versions

3. **Dialyzer** (runs once)
   - Type checking with Dialyzer
   - PLT files cached for faster builds

#### Caching Strategy

The workflow includes intelligent caching:
- Dependencies (`deps/`, `_build/`)
- PLT files (`priv/plts/`) for faster Dialyzer runs

#### Multi-Version Testing

Tests run on:
- Elixir 1.16.0 + OTP 26.2
- Elixir 1.15.7 + OTP 25.3
- Elixir 1.14.5 + OTP 25.3

### Adding to Your Project

The workflow is installed when you run `mix bmad.init`. To use it in your Phoenix project:

1. Ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists
2. Ensure you have `mix.exs` with precommit alias configured
3. Push to GitHub - the workflow runs automatically

### Status Badges

Add CI status badges to your README:

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/yourusername/your_repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/your_repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

## Configuration

Edit `.bmad/config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
project:
  name: MyPhoenixApp
  type: elixir_phoenix

agents:
  default: elixir-dev
  available:
    - elixir-architect
    - elixir-dev
    - elixir-qa

quality:
  pre_commit:
    - mix format --check-formatted
    - mix credo --strict
    - mix dialyzer
